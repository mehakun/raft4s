# raft4s. Implementation of RAFT protocol in pure functional Scala

Existing open-source implementations are using akka so I decided to provide implementation without it.

Also during implementation I will train skills in:
* Working with external storage
* Handling imperative logic with monads
* Working with codecs and network
* Testing logic mentioned above
